# Beargotchi
The sister repository for the 'Beargotchi' project,  this is to be C based and the next step in developing the full product.

The bear tamagotchi project is to spin up a Tamagotchi like device but bear-like instead. Eventually encapsulating all 8 bear species. First starting with the Polar Bear and then moving onto the others. 

Desgin and spec documents are (to be) located in their respective folders. 

## Build System

In order to allow everyone to participate who has a STM32 chip /nucleo board. CMake files and appropriate abstraction for the pin configs (will be) introduced. 

(Please include data sheets so I know what to do with whatever chip a person has.) 

#TODO Document build system for onboarding purposes
